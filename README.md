# MCInstaller

A program that does the job of installing Minecraft Bedrock for you.

## Why did I make this?

I couldn't deal with the people asking me how to install Minecraft Bedrock Edition anymore so I just decided to create an app that automates the entire task with very little input from your side.

## Installation instructions

- Download the latest zip from the [releases]("https://github.com/donut2008/MCInstaller/releases") page
- Extract it to any directory you prefer
- Install the app's certificate (instructions can be found [here](#cert-install-instructions))
- Install the app package (.msixbundle)

Installing Minecraft is pretty straightforward and instructions are available in the app.

## Certificate installation instructions

- Double click on the certificate in the extracted folder
- Click on `Install Certificate`
- In the dialog that opens, select `Local Machine`
- Allow the UAC prompt
- Select `Place all certificates in the following store'
- Click `Browse`
- Search for `Trusted People`
- Click `Next` and then `Finish`

Once you finish doing this, you can install the app normally.
